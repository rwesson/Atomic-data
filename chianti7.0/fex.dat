%Observed and Theoretical energies (levels 1-54): Del Zanna, Berrington, Mason, 2004, A&A, 422, 731
%Observed energy levels (55-172): NIST Database for Atomic Spectroscopy, Version 1.0, NIST Standard 
   Reference Database 61, 1995
%theoretical energy levels (55-172): Malinovsky et al., 1980, ApJ, 235, 665
%comment: The second column has the theoretical energies of the  scattering calculations,
   while the third column has the theoretical energies from the SUPERSTRUCTURE calculation 
   (with term energy corrections).

%A values and oscillator strengths (levels 1-54): Del Zanna, Berrington, Mason, 2004, A&A, 422, 731
%comment: Theoretical wavelengths for levels 1-54 are obtained from the SUPERSTRUCTURE calculation
   (with term energy corrections) in the .elvlc file, from Del Zanna, Berrington, Mason, 2004, A&A, 422, 731
%A values (levels 55-172): A SSTRUCT run performed by P.R.Young.
%comment: the A values for transitions between levels 55-172 have been calculated using a
    configuration model of Fe X in SSTRUCT. The configurations included were:

    3s2 3p5,  3s 3p6,  3s2 3p4 3d,  3s 3p5 3d,  3p6 3d
    3s2 3p3 3d2,  3s 3p4 3d2
    3s2 3p4 4s,  3s2 3p4 4p,  3s2 3p4 4d
    3s2 3p4 4f,  3s2 3p4 5s,  3s2 3p4 5p
    3s 3p5 4s,   3s 3p5 4p,   3s 3p5 5s

%Oscillator strengths (levels 1-54): Del Zanna,  Berrington, Mason, 2004, A&A, 422, 731 (scattering calculation)
%Collision data for transitions to the first three levels: Pelan, Berrington, A&A 2001, 365, 258
%Collision data for transitions to levels up to 54: Del Zanna,  Berrington, Mason, 2004, A&A, 422, 731
%collision strengths for transitions to levels 55-172: Malinovsky et al., ApJ 235, 665, 1980
%comment: Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths have been calculated in the temperature range 2.5 10^5 - 10^7 K
%comment:      Although for many of the transitions involving levels >62 there
     were gf values available, they have been fitted as Type 2
     transitions. This is because, as Type 1 transitions they were often
     difficult to fit (the 1-89 transition is a typical example).

     Some of the 4s transitions (levels 55-62) showed unusual shapes
     in the omega structure (e.g., 2-56, 1-58). I'm not sure how
     trustworthy this data is.
